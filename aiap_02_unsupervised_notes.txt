Within themselves - check code readability with peers on their own (peer code review) 

Case studies 
PCA + clustering: customer segmentation - anomalies? (GMM low prob of membership or hierarchical clustering (far branch means low membership) 
Association rules on individual segments 
Supervised customer value prediction 
Along the way touch on clean code and reproducibility
